# QUILL Scripting & Quillins — Design & Implementation

Status: **Implemented (framework foundation)** · Branch: `edsharp`

This document is both the design rationale and the authoritative authoring
reference for **Quillins**, QUILL's extension framework. The framework described
here is **implemented and tested in the codebase** (`quill/core/quillins/*` and
`quill/ui/main_frame_quillins.py`); see the Implementation Status map in §0a for
the module-by-module mapping. Third-party Quillin **execution** is deliberately
gated off for QUILL 1.0 by the SEC-8 `core.third_party_plugins` feature flag
(`locked_off`), so a shipping 1.0 build discovers and runs no third-party code
while the framework, the Quillins Manager, and the full test bar are in place.

## 0a. Implementation status (module map)

Every design element below is backed by a shipping, wx-free `quill/core` module
(plus one `quill/ui` mixin) and a test. The neutral technical terms
(`extension`, `quill.extension/1`, `ext.*`, `QuillExtensionApi`) are the stable
wire/code identifiers; the experience speaks of **Quillins**.

| Bundled Quillin (Tier C: Layer 1 snippet + Layer 2 handler) | `quill/quillins_bundled/markdown-helpers/` | `tests/unit/core/test_quillins_bundled_markdown.py` |

A complete, loadable **bundled Quillin** ships in
[`quill/quillins_bundled/markdown-helpers/`](../quill/quillins_bundled/markdown-helpers/):
a `manifest.json` contributing a Layer 1 front-matter snippet
(`ext.mdh.frontmatter`) and a Layer 2 bold-selection handler (`ext.mdh.bold`),
plus an `extension.py` entry module.
`tests/unit/core/test_quillins_bundled_markdown.py`
validates the manifest, builds a conflict-free contribution registry, expands the
snippet, and drives the handler — and the same directory loads and runs through
the real out-of-process host worker. As a **Tier C bundled Quillin** it ships
enabled (gated by the on-by-default `core.bundled_quillins` flag, wholly
independent of the SEC-8 third-party lock) and is the canonical template for
authoring a new Quillin.

### Submitting a Quillin

Authoring a Quillin for submission is governed by three companion pieces:

- **[Quillin Author Covenant](quillin-code-of-conduct.md)** — the code of
  conduct for Quillin *code*: accessibility (announce every outcome,
  keyboard-complete), capability minimization and honesty, no silent network or
  telemetry, privacy, security (no obfuscation, no sandbox-escape, no malware),
  licensing, and namespace etiquette. Every submission attests to it.
- **[Submission guide](quillin-submission.md)** — the end-to-end author journey:
  directory layout, manifest authoring, self-lint, tests, the PR template, and
  the review criteria.
- **The submission linter** — `python -m quill.tools.quillin_lint <dir> --strict`
  (`quill/tools/quillin_lint.py`) applies three lenses: an *executable* check of
  the published JSON Schema (`quill/core/schemas/extension.json`), the contract
  validator the loader enforces, and a structure/capability-hygiene gate. The
  `Quillin Verify` workflow (`.github/workflows/quillin-verify.yml`) runs it on
  every submission, so a Quillin cannot land without passing.

This document is a design plan turned reference; where it describes future,
optional, or 2.0-scale work it says so explicitly (the QuickJS evaluator in §9,
and the internal modularization in §16).

## Naming: Quillins

QUILL's plugins are branded **Quillins**. Throughout this document "Quillin" and
"Quillins" are the product-facing name for a QUILL extension in everything a user
reads or hears: menus, the manager dialog, announcements, capability prompts, and
documentation. The neutral technical terms — `extension`, the `quill.extension/1`
manifest schema, the `ext.*` command namespace, and the `QuillExtensionApi` —
remain unchanged in code, schemas, and APIs, so wire formats stay stable while the
experience speaks of Quillins. Where this document describes schema or code, it
uses the technical term; where it describes what a person sees or hears, it says
Quillin.


## 0. Provenance and inspiration

This capability is QUILL's answer to the scripting/add-in model pioneered by
earlier accessible, screen-reader-first Windows editors that exposed almost
their entire object model to add-in code.

Those editors typically scripted the host application in **the host's own
language**: when the application was written in C#/.NET, the add-in language was
a .NET language, so the scripting language matched the platform object model and
its class library. The faithful translation of that design for QUILL is to
expose **QUILL's own object model**, which is **Python** &mdash; see the language
decision below.

## 1. Goals and non-goals

### Goals

- Let power users add **menu items**, **context-menu entries**, and **hotkeys**
  that run custom actions, without rebuilding QUILL.
- Keep the **writing path plain-text-first** and the **screen-reader-first**
  guarantees intact: extensions must never degrade NVDA/JAWS/Narrator parity.
- Make extensions **safe by default**: no ambient filesystem, network, or
  subprocess access unless explicitly declared and user-granted, consistent with
  QUILL's existing consent gates, DPAPI secret handling, and "no silent network
  calls" rule.
- Make extensions **authorable by blind power users** &mdash; the same audience
  those editors served &mdash;
  with plain-text manifests, readable Python, and accessible install/enable UX.
- Preserve the architecture boundary: `quill/core` and `quill/io` stay
  UI-framework-agnostic; only `quill/ui` and `quill/platform/windows` touch `wx`.

### Non-goals (explicitly out of scope for the first iteration)

- A live rich-text/RTF editing surface (a standing QUILL design exclusion).
- Arbitrary native code plugins or replacing core UI widgets.
- A general-purpose marketplace / auto-update of third-party extensions (later).
- JavaScript as the *primary* extension language (see §3; a QuickJS **snippet
  expression evaluator** is noted as optional future work only).

## 2. Language decision (resolved)

**Two-layer model, with Python as the scripting language, not JavaScript.**

Rationale: QUILL's platform object model is Python, so scripting it in Python is
the lowest-friction, most powerful, most debuggable, and most maintainable
option — and it is the faithful analogue of scripting a .NET editor in a .NET
language. Choosing JavaScript as the primary language would mean maintaining
a second runtime and a permanent Python⇄JS marshalling layer purely to script an
application that is already Python. JavaScript's only strong advantage
(familiarity) does not outweigh that cost.

A comparison of the options considered (Python, embedded JavaScript via
QuickJS/V8, Lua via `lupa`, WASM via Extism, declarative-only) is retained in
Appendix A.

## 3. Architecture: two layers

### Layer 1 — Declarative manifest (safe, covers the common ~70%)

A static, schema-validated manifest (JSON, validated like every other QUILL
store under `quill/core/schemas/`) that **maps** menu items, context-menu
entries, and hotkeys onto:

- existing built-in QUILL command IDs (the same IDs used in
  `quill/core/keymap.py`), and/or
- text **snippets / templates** (no executable code).

This layer is **non-Turing-complete and fully sandboxable** — it can do nothing
except invoke commands QUILL already trusts and insert literal text. Most real
"add a menu item / bind a key / add a right-click action" requests are satisfied
here with effectively zero risk.

### Layer 2 — Python extension API (real logic, isolated)

For genuine custom logic, an extension ships a Python entry point that QUILL runs
**out-of-process** (mirroring the existing OCR worker-process precedent in the
concurrency model) behind a **capability-gated RPC bridge**. The extension never
imports `wx` and never touches the editor widget directly; it talks to a narrow,
versioned API object and all UI effects are marshalled back onto the UI thread
via `wx.CallAfter`.

```text
+------------------+        capability-gated RPC         +-----------------------+
|  QUILL UI thread | <--------------------------------> | Extension host worker |
|  (wx, main_frame)|   (stdio/pipe, JSON messages)      |  (sandboxed Python)   |
+------------------+                                     +-----------------------+
        |  registers menu/hotkey/context hooks                   |
        |  marshals results via wx.CallAfter                     | user extension code
        v                                                        v
   core command dispatch                                  QuillExtensionApi (v1)
```

## 4. Manifest schema (Layer 1 sketch)

Stored per-extension under `%APPDATA%\Quill\extensions\<id>\manifest.json`,
schema-validated, atomic-written, with `.bak`/recovery like other stores.

```jsonc
{
  "schema": "quill.extension/1",
  "id": "com.example.wraptools",
  "name": "Wrap Tools",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Jane Power-User",
  "license": "MIT",
  "capabilities": ["editor.read", "editor.write"],   // requested permissions
  "contributes": {
    "commands": [
      { "id": "ext.wraptools.fence", "title": "Wrap In Code Fence",
        "run": { "snippet": "```\n${selection}\n```" } }
    ],
    "menus": [
      { "parent": "Format", "command": "ext.wraptools.fence" }
    ],
    "context_menu": [
      { "when": "editor.hasSelection", "command": "ext.wraptools.fence" }
    ],
    "hotkeys": [
      { "command": "ext.wraptools.fence", "binding": "Ctrl+Shift+Grave, F" }
    ]
  },
  "main": "extension.py"   // optional; presence triggers Layer 2 host
}
```

Notes:

- `hotkeys[].binding` reuses QUILL's existing binding grammar, including the
  **QUILL Key** chord prefix (`Ctrl+Shift+Grave, …`). Conflicts are detected with
  the existing `find_keymap_conflict` logic and reported to the user; extension
  bindings never silently override user/default bindings.
- `menus[].parent` / `context_menu[]` register through the existing menu and
  context-menu construction paths in `quill/ui`, honouring the project rule to
  **defer menu mutations until menus are closed**.
- A `command.run.snippet` with no `main` is pure Layer 1 (no code execution).

## 5. The Python extension API (Layer 2 sketch)

A single, versioned, capability-checked facade — no direct widget access:

```python
class QuillExtensionApi:        # v1, passed to the extension's register()
    # editor.read
    def get_text(self) -> str: ...
    def get_selection(self) -> str: ...
    def get_cursor(self) -> CursorAddress: ...     # line, column, percent
    # editor.write   (all routed through core commands + undo history)
    def replace_selection(self, text: str) -> None: ...
    def insert_text(self, text: str) -> None: ...
    # ui (always marshalled to the UI thread)
    def announce(self, message: str) -> None: ...  # screen-reader announcement
    def register_command(self, command_id: str, title: str, handler) -> None: ...
    # fs / net only if capability granted + user-consented at install/run
    def read_file(self, path: str) -> str: ...     # requires "fs.read"
    def fetch(self, url: str) -> Response: ...      # requires "net" + consent gate
```

Design rules:

- Every method maps to an existing core operation so extension edits flow through
  **command + history** (undoable) and through the **announcement engine** for
  consistent NVDA/JAWS/Narrator output.
- All editor mutations go through `quill/core`; the extension process holds **no**
  `wx` reference and **no** direct buffer handle.
- The API is **versioned** (`v1`); breaking changes ship a new version while old
  extensions keep working against the old facade.

## 6. Security & consent model

- **Default deny.** No capability ⇒ no filesystem, no network, no subprocess.
  Pure-snippet extensions need no capabilities at all.
- **Declared + granted.** Capabilities are listed in the manifest and **shown to
  the user at install/enable time**; network/file capabilities additionally pass
  through QUILL's existing per-action **consent gate** with visible progress and
  outcome (no silent network calls).
- **Isolation.** Layer 2 runs out-of-process; a crash or hang in an extension
  cannot take down the editor or corrupt the buffer (the UI side owns the buffer).
- **No secrets to extensions.** Extensions never receive DPAPI-protected secrets
  or document content over the wire unless a capability + consent explicitly
  authorise it; **no document content is ever logged**.
- **Signing/trust (later).** A future iteration may add signature/trust prompts
  and a per-extension audit log.

## 7. Accessibility of the authoring experience

- Manifests are plain JSON and extensions are plain `.py` — both fully readable in
  QUILL itself, following that same authoring philosophy.
- The **Quillins Manager** dialog uses stock controls
  (`wx.ListBox` / `wx.TextCtrl` read-only review panes, explicit default buttons,
  consistent Escape/Close handling, focus returned to the editor on close) per
  the project's dialog/accessibility rules, and is registered in `dialogs.md`.
- Errors from extension code surface as **announced**, reviewable text (a
  read-only multiline control), never as transient-only message boxes.

## 8. Packaging

- Bundled with the existing Windows distribution builder / Inno Setup component
  model. Layer 1 + Layer 2 (Python host) need **no new native runtime** because
  the interpreter already ships with QUILL.
- The optional QuickJS snippet evaluator (Appendix B) would be the *only* item
  that adds a native dependency, which is why it is deferred and optional.

## 9. Optional future: JavaScript snippet evaluator (QuickJS)

Strictly optional, post-foundation, for literal `.js`-snippet parity:
embed **QuickJS** (tiny, no ambient I/O by default) as an **expression/snippet
evaluator** only — e.g. a "Evaluate Expression" command and `.js` snippet tokens.
It would **not** be the extension
API. Capabilities would be granted explicitly, identical to the Python layer.

## 10. Phasing / milestones

Status note: **M1–M3 are implemented and tested** (see §0a). M4 remains optional
future work. Third-party execution stays gated off for 1.0 (SEC-8).

1. **M1 — Manifest + loader (Layer 1): _Done._** Schema, validation, load/enable/
   disable, command/menu/context/hotkey registration, conflict detection,
   Quillins Manager dialog. No code execution.
2. **M2 — Python host (Layer 2): _Done._** Out-of-process worker, RPC bridge,
   `QuillExtensionApi v1` with `editor.read`/`editor.write`/`announce`/
   `register_command`, undo/announcement integration through the host services.
3. **M3 — Capabilities + consent: _Done._** `fs.read`/`fs.write`/`net`,
   install-time disclosure, per-action consent gate. (A per-extension audit log
   remains a future enhancement.)
4. **M4 (optional) — QuickJS snippet evaluator** for `.js` snippet parity.

## 11. Testing strategy

Status note: **this strategy is implemented** — the test files are listed in the
§0a map. The bar below is what those tests enforce.

- `quill/core` (manifest model, schema validation, snippet expansion, capability
  checks, conflict detection, loader/SEC-8 gating): real unit tests, wx-free,
  strict mypy. The schema artifact and the hand-rolled validator are asserted to
  agree (capability enum, menu parents, schema id).
- UI registration (menu/context/hotkey wiring, Manager dialog): source-contract
  tests (`tests/unit/ui/test_main_frame_quillins.py`) plus the A11Y-4 dialog
  inventory/contract guard for the Quillins Manager dialog.
- Host/RPC bridge: integration tests
  (`tests/integration/test_quillins_host_integration.py`) spawn the real worker
  subprocess and exercise read/write/announce, the capability-denied path, the
  consent-denied path, network-with-consent, handler-error isolation, and main-
  module path containment.
- Security: explicit tests that an undeclared capability is rejected (in-worker
  and at the dispatcher), that consent defaults to deny, and that diagnostic
  `log` output never reaches user announcements.

## 12. Open questions for review

1. Distribution: local folder install only for 2.0, or a curated gallery later?
2. Do we want per-extension **profiles** (tie enablement to QUILL feature
   profiles) in the first cut, or global enable/disable only?
3. Hotkey precedence when an extension binding conflicts with a user rebinding —
   reject (proposed) vs. prompt-to-override?
4. Should Layer 1 snippets support the existing snippet token system, unifying
   "snippets" and "extension snippets" into one engine?
5. Minimum capability set for M2 — is `editor.read` + `editor.write` + `announce`
   enough to be useful, deferring `fs`/`net` to M3?

---

## 13. Manifest JSON Schema (normative)

This is the authoritative, machine-validatable contract for `quill.extension/1`
manifests. It is the schema that will live under `quill/core/schemas/` and be
enforced by the loader. AI or human authors can validate a generated manifest
against this before submission.

## 14. Extension authoring reference (humans and AI)

This section is the complete, self-contained reference an author needs. It is
written so an LLM can produce a valid, working extension from this document
alone, with no access to QUILL source.

### 14.1 Capability catalogue

| Capability | Grants | Consent | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `editor.read` | Read buffer text, selection, cursor address | Install-time disclosure | Required by `get_text`, `get_selection`, `get_cursor` |
| `editor.write` | Insert text, replace selection (undoable) | Install-time disclosure | All writes flow through core command + history |
| `ui.announce` | Send screen-reader announcements | Install-time disclosure | Required by `announce` |
| `ui.command` | Register `handler` commands invoked from menus/hotkeys | Install-time disclosure | Required when `run.handler` is used |
| `fs.read` / `fs.write` | Read/write files by path | Per-action consent gate | Paths validated; no access outside granted scope |
| `net` | Outbound HTTP(S) | Per-action consent gate, visible progress | No silent network calls — ever |
| `clipboard.read` / `clipboard.write` | Read/write the system clipboard | Install-time disclosure | |

A pure snippet-only extension declares **no** capabilities.

### 14.2 Contribution reference

- **commands** — declare an `ext.*`-namespaced id + human title; `run` is either a
  `snippet` (Layer 1, no code) or a `handler` (Layer 2, requires `main` +
  `ui.command`).
- **menus** — attach a command under a fixed top-level menu (`parent`). Menu
  mutation is deferred until menus close (project rule).
- **context_menu** — attach a command to the editor right-click menu, optionally
  guarded by a `when` predicate.
- **hotkeys** — bind a command using QUILL's binding grammar, including the QUILL
  Key chord prefix `Ctrl+Shift+Grave, <key>`. Conflicts are detected with the
  same logic as user keymaps and **rejected with an announced message**.

### 14.3 Snippet placeholder reference (Layer 1)

| Placeholder | Expands to |
| --- | --- |
| `${selection}` | Current selection (empty string if none) |
| `${clipboard}` | Current clipboard text (requires `clipboard.read`) |
| `${date}` | Current date in the user's configured format |
| `${time}` | Current time in the user's configured format |
| `${filename}` | Current document file name (empty if unsaved) |
| `${cursor}` | Final cursor position marker after insertion |

### 14.4 Python API reference (Layer 2, `QuillExtensionApi` v1)

Every extension's entry module defines a top-level `register(api)` function.
QUILL calls it once when the extension loads. All methods are synchronous from
the extension's perspective; UI effects are marshalled onto the UI thread by the
host. Methods raise `CapabilityError` if the required capability was not granted.

| Method | Capability | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `api.register_command(command_id, handler)` | `ui.command` | `None` | Bind a `handler` name (referenced by `run.handler`) to a callable `handler(ctx)` |
| `api.get_text()` | `editor.read` | `str` | Full document text |
| `api.get_selection()` | `editor.read` | `str` | Selected text (`""` if none) |
| `api.get_cursor()` | `editor.read` | `CursorAddress` | `.line` (1-based), `.column` (1-based), `.percent` (0–100) |
| `api.insert_text(text)` | `editor.write` | `None` | Insert at cursor (undoable) |
| `api.replace_selection(text)` | `editor.write` | `None` | Replace selection, or insert if none (undoable) |
| `api.announce(message)` | `ui.announce` | `None` | Screen-reader announcement via the announcement engine |
| `api.read_file(path)` | `fs.read` | `str` | Read a text file (consent-gated) |
| `api.write_file(path, text)` | `fs.write` | `None` | Write a text file (consent-gated) |
| `api.fetch(url, *, method="GET", body=None)` | `net` | `Response` | HTTP(S) request (consent-gated, visible progress) |
| `api.get_clipboard()` | `clipboard.read` | `str` | Clipboard text |
| `api.set_clipboard(text)` | `clipboard.write` | `None` | Set clipboard text |

`handler(ctx)` receives a `ctx` exposing the same read/write/announce surface
scoped to the invocation, so a handler typically reads, computes, and writes back.

Error types an author may see: `CapabilityError`, `ConsentDeniedError`,
`ConflictError` (hotkey/menu), `ApiVersionError`.

### 14.5 Worked example A — snippet-only (no capabilities, no code)

`manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "schema": "quill.extension/1",
  "id": "com.example.fence",
  "name": "Code Fence",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "contributes": {
    "commands": [
      { "id": "ext.fence.wrap", "title": "Wrap In Code Fence",
        "run": { "snippet": "```\n${selection}\n```\n${cursor}" } }
    ],
    "context_menu": [ { "when": "editor.hasSelection", "command": "ext.fence.wrap" } ],
    "hotkeys": [ { "command": "ext.fence.wrap", "binding": "Ctrl+Shift+Grave, F" } ]
  }
}
```

### 14.6 Worked example B — Python handler

`manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "schema": "quill.extension/1",
  "id": "com.example.titlecase",
  "name": "Title Case",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "capabilities": ["editor.read", "editor.write", "ui.announce", "ui.command"],
  "main": "extension.py",
  "contributes": {
    "commands": [
      { "id": "ext.titlecase.run", "title": "Title Case Selection",
        "run": { "handler": "title_case" } }
    ],
    "menus": [ { "parent": "Format", "command": "ext.titlecase.run" } ],
    "hotkeys": [ { "command": "ext.titlecase.run", "binding": "Ctrl+Shift+Grave, T" } ]
  }
}
```

`extension.py`:

```python
def register(api):
    def title_case(ctx):
        text = ctx.get_selection()
        if not text:
            ctx.announce("Title Case: no selection")
            return
        ctx.replace_selection(text.title())
        ctx.announce("Title Case applied")
    api.register_command("title_case", title_case)
```

## 15. AI authoring guide — deterministic generation contract

This section gives an AI agent an unambiguous procedure to generate a valid
extension. Following it should yield a manifest that passes §13 and an entry
module that loads under §14.4.

**Generation checklist (must all hold):**

1. `schema` is exactly `"quill.extension/1"`.
2. `id` is reverse-DNS, lowercase, matches the §13 pattern, and is globally unique.
3. `version` is `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
4. Every contributed command `id` starts with `ext.` and is unique within the file.
5. Every `menus[].command`, `context_menu[].command`, and `hotkeys[].command`
   references either a contributed command id or a documented built-in id.
6. If **any** command uses `run.handler`, then `main` is present **and**
   `capabilities` includes `ui.command`.
7. `capabilities` is the minimal set: include a capability **iff** an API method
   or placeholder in the extension requires it (see §14.1, §14.3, §14.4).
8. Hotkey `binding` uses the QUILL grammar; prefer the QUILL Key prefix
   (`Ctrl+Shift+Grave, <letter>`) to avoid clashing with built-ins.
9. The Python entry module defines exactly one top-level `register(api)` and
   registers every `handler` name referenced by the manifest.
10. No `wx` import, no direct filesystem/network/subprocess/clipboard access
    except through the granted `api` methods.

**Minimal-capability decision table:**

| If the extension… | Declare |
| --- | --- |
| only inserts literal/snippet text | *(none)* |
| reads buffer/selection/cursor | `editor.read` |
| inserts or replaces text | `editor.write` |
| speaks to the screen reader | `ui.announce` |
| has any `run.handler` command | `ui.command` + `main` |
| reads/writes files | `fs.read` / `fs.write` |
| makes network requests | `net` |
| touches the clipboard | `clipboard.read` / `clipboard.write` |

**Machine-readable contract summary (for prompt embedding):**

```text
ENTRYPOINT: register(api) -> None              # exactly one, top-level
HANDLER:    handler(ctx) -> None               # ctx mirrors api read/write/announce
WRITES:     undoable, via core commands only
THREADING:  api is sync; UI effects marshalled by host (never call wx)
DENY:       no capability => no fs/net/subprocess/clipboard
NAMESPACE:  command ids must start with "ext."
CONFLICTS:  hotkey/menu conflicts are rejected + announced, never overridden
VERSION:    target QuillExtensionApi v1
```

## 16. Internal modularization — core as a framework

A deliberate, longer-horizon consequence of this design: the **contribution
grammar** defined here (commands, menus, hotkeys, context-menu entries) is the
same vocabulary QUILL already uses *internally* to wire up its built-in
features. That makes it a natural blueprint for decomposing the
`quill/ui/main_frame.py` "god object" into self-registering **first-party
feature modules**, leaving `quill/core` as a genuine framework.

### 16.1 Two tiers, one vocabulary

There are **two tiers of extension**, sharing one contribution grammar but
differing in **trust level and API breadth** — not in how they appear to users.

| | First-party feature modules | Third-party extensions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trust | Trusted, shipped, reviewed | Untrusted |
| Process | In-process | Out-of-process (Appendix B) |
| API breadth | Rich, synchronous host API (editor, dialogs, settings, undo, workers, platform, announcements) | Narrow, capability-gated `QuillExtensionApi` (§5) |
| Sandbox | None needed (trusted code) | Mandatory (§6) |
| Registration | Same contribution grammar (§4) | Same contribution grammar (§4) |

The crucial rule: **first-party features must NOT be routed through the
sandboxed, out-of-process, capability-gated path.** Built-ins need rich,
synchronous, in-process access; forcing them across the RPC bridge would be a
severe downgrade in capability, latency (per-keystroke operations!), and
complexity for zero security benefit, since the code is already trusted.

### 16.2 What this enables

- An internal `register(host)` module interface, where `host` exposes the rich
  trusted API. Related commands (line-ops, EDS parity, search, formatting…) are
  extracted from `main_frame.py` into self-registering modules.
- `quill/core` keeps only the framework: document model, command registry,
  keymap, event bus, feature gating, and the announcement engine.
- The contribution grammar (this document) becomes the single registration
  mechanism for both tiers.

### 16.3 Honest limits (do not over-rotate)

- **Do not pluginize the editor surface or the accessibility / announcement
  engine.** The plain-text `wx.TextCtrl` writing path and NVDA/JAWS/Narrator
  parity are the framework's central guarantee, not a plugin. Delegating them is
  how accessibility regresses.
- `main_frame.py` is deeply entangled (shared mutable state, wx id maps, ordering
  dependencies). Decompose **incrementally and opportunistically, behind
  characterization tests** — never a big-bang "everything is a plugin" rewrite.
- Feature profiles already deliver much of the user-facing modularity benefit, so
  the refactor's justification is **maintainability**, not new capability.
- This is a **2.0-scale effort**, sequenced after user-facing wins.

### 16.4 The migration playbook

The concrete, sequenced procedure for moving first-party code off the
`main_frame.py` god object and onto this contribution grammar — pilot selection,
the `register(host)` module shape, the host-facade surface, characterization-test
discipline, and a wave-by-wave order — lives in a dedicated companion document:
**`docs/quillin-migration-plan.md`**. Read this section for the *why*; read that
document for the *how*.

## 17. Seamless use, transparent governance

Extensions should be **indistinguishable from built-in features at the point of
use**, while remaining **fully auditable and controllable** in management.

### 17.1 Seamless at the point of use

A user should never be able to tell, while writing, whether a command came from
core, a bundled module, or a third-party extension. All of them:

- appear in the same menus, command palette, and context menus;
- bind through the same keymap (and surface in the key-describer / learning
  mode);
- announce outcomes through the same announcement engine with NVDA/JAWS/Narrator
  parity;
- respect the same feature-gating and Settings UI.

That uniformity is exactly *why* both tiers share one contribution grammar
(§16.1). No second-class citizens; no "bolted-on" feel.

### 17.2 Transparent where it matters (non-negotiable)

Seamlessness hides the *seam*, never the *capabilities*. Consistent with QUILL's
"no silent network calls", per-action consent, and DPAPI rules:

- A **Quillins Manager** lists every installed Quillin, its publisher, and
  its granted capabilities, so the user can audit, disable, or revoke.
- **Capability prompts** (§6) surface the first time an untrusted extension wants
  something sensitive (network, filesystem beyond the document, clipboard, running
  executables). Trusted first-party modules do not prompt; third-party ones do.
- **Provenance is visible on demand** (e.g. in command-palette details or a
  "Where did this come from?" affordance), even though it is invisible by default.

Principle: **users should not have to *think* about whether something is an
extension during normal use, but must always be *able to find out* and *control
it* when trust or accessibility is at stake.** Hiding the seam is a UX win;
hiding capabilities or network access would violate QUILL's privacy-first
contract.

## 18. Declarative dialogs & accessibility enforcement

Extensions may contribute **dialogs**, but they **describe** dialogs
declaratively — they never instantiate a `wx` widget. QUILL renders them. This
makes inaccessible or unsafe UI **structurally impossible** rather than merely
discouraged.

### 18.1 The mechanism

QUILL already has the right primitive: `show_web_form` (`quill/ui/web_form.py`)
builds a dialog from a **field spec** using vetted stock controls
(`wx.TextCtrl`, `wx.ListBox`, `wx.Dialog`) with consistent focus, a default
button, and Escape/Close handling. (The EDS `DLG-1` migrations already use it.)

An extension contributes a dialog description:

```json
{
  "dialog": "calculate_date",
  "title": "Calculate Date",
  "fields": [
    { "id": "anchor", "label": "Start date", "type": "text" },
    { "id": "offset", "label": "Days to add", "type": "number" },
    { "id": "unit",   "label": "Unit", "type": "choice",
      "choices": ["days", "weeks", "months"] }
  ]
}
```

…and receives back a plain dict (`{anchor, offset, unit}`). It never creates a
control, sets a sizer, or manages focus.

### 18.2 Why this enforces accessibility without risk

- **Accessibility is structural, not requested.** Every dialog comes from QUILL's
  one renderer, so it inherits stock-control usage, focus return to editor,
  label/announcement parity, and the **A11Y-4 dialog-contract guard**
  automatically. An extension *cannot* produce an inaccessible dialog because it
  cannot produce a dialog at all — only a description of one.
- **No untrusted code in the UI thread.** Third-party logic stays out-of-process
  (Appendix B); only data crosses the boundary. A buggy or malicious extension
  cannot freeze the UI, draw a custom-painted control, or break screen-reader
  focus.
- **`dialogs.md` stays truthful.** Because the renderer is central, contributed
  dialogs are enumerable and can be registered into the manual regression map the
  same way native dialogs are.

### 18.3 Constrained vocabulary is the safety property

- The field-type catalogue is intentionally **finite**: text, multiline
  read-only, number, choice, checkbox, file-pick-with-consent, list. Allowing
  "arbitrary layout" or "custom control" would forfeit the guarantee — so it is
  not allowed. That finiteness *is* the safety property.
- Genuinely novel custom UI is **out of scope** for extensions; it must be a
  first-party module reviewed against A11Y-4 (§16.1), not a sandboxed extension.
- Anything sensitive a dialog *triggers* (network, file write, run executable)
  still passes through capability prompts (§6). An accessible dialog never
  bypasses consent.

## 19. Design principles carried from the editor proposals (rtf.md)

The native-RTF, Compose-mode, keyword, and grammar proposals in `rtf.md` share a
through-line: take a capability the rest of the industry built for the eye and
make QUILL the place where it finally *speaks*. Quillins are an extensibility
system, but the same principles apply, and applying them is what turns a competent
plugin model into a delightful, screen-reader-first one. This section adapts those
principles to Quillins.

### 19.1 Spoken-first: every Quillin action announces its outcome

The defining rtf.md rule is that every action reports its consequence aloud, in the
shared announcement grammar, so a blind user never has to re-derive what happened.
Quillins adopt this as a hard contract, not an option:

- Installing, enabling, disabling, updating, or removing a Quillin announces the
  result and the new state ("Enabled Title Case. 4 Quillins active.").
- Granting or revoking a capability speaks exactly what changed ("Granted network
  access to Weather Insert. This Quillin can now make outbound requests, with a
  prompt each time.").
- A Quillin command that completes speaks its outcome through the same engine
  built-ins use, so `api.announce` is not a courtesy but the expected closing act
  of every handler; the authoring guide (§15) should treat a silent handler as a
  smell.
- Failures surface as announced, reviewable text (a read-only multiline control),
  never a transient-only beep, mirroring §7 and the rtf.md "speak the consequence"
  rule.

This is the single most important enhancement: a Quillin that cannot be heard is a
second-class citizen, and QUILL's promise is that there are none.

### 19.2 The Quillins Manager as an accessible tree

rtf.md argues the outline *is* the document and that QUILL already ships the right
primitive: the accessible tree-navigator (`_NavigatorNode` and
`_show_tree_navigator` in `quill/ui/main_frame.py`, used today for the heading
outline, EPUB chapters, and the misspelling list). The Quillins Manager should
reuse that exact pattern rather than a flat list:

- A tree groups Quillins by provenance (First-party, Installed) and, within each,
  by capability footprint (No capabilities, Editor only, Filesystem, Network,
  Clipboard), so a user can hear "everything that can reach the network" as one
  branch.
- Each node speaks its essentials on focus: name, publisher, version, enabled
  state, and granted capabilities, the way rtf.md has each tree node announce its
  title, level, and state.
- Arrow keys walk the structure; expanding a capability branch is how a user
  audits risk by ear, the accessible answer to a sighted user scanning a column of
  permission icons.
- A live, read-only detail pane sits beside the tree (exactly as the YAML
  structure editor and the rtf.md Compose preview place detail beside structure),
  showing the selected Quillin's manifest, capabilities, and provenance.

### 19.3 A rich, spoken context menu on the manager tree

Following the rtf.md Compose-mode context menu, right-clicking a Quillin in the
manager opens a structure menu where every item is keyboard reachable and every
action announces its outcome and confirms only what is destructive:

| Menu item | Action | Spoken outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enable / Disable | Toggles the Quillin | "Disabled Title Case. 3 Quillins active." |
| Review Capabilities | Speaks and shows the granted capability set | reads the capability list |
| Revoke Capability... | Removes a granted capability (confirm) | "Revoked network access from Weather Insert." |
| Inspect Manifest | Opens the manifest in a read-only review pane | "Showing manifest for Title Case." |
| Where Did This Come From? | Speaks provenance and publisher | "Title Case, first-party, shipped with QUILL." |
| View Commands and Bindings | Lists the Quillin's commands and hotkeys | reads each command and its binding |
| Update / Reinstall | Re-reads the Quillin from disk | "Reloaded Title Case from disk." |
| Remove... | Uninstalls the Quillin (confirm) | "Removed Title Case. 3 Quillins active." |

Reordering-style, instantly reversible actions (enable, disable) never prompt;
capability revocation and removal confirm through a native accessible dialog, per
the rtf.md "friction only where loss is possible" rule.

### 19.4 Provenance and capabilities as spoken objects

rtf.md reframes keywords from visual chips into spoken objects a user can hear,
filter, and jump through. Quillins apply the same move to provenance and
capabilities, which are otherwise the classic "colored badge you must see":

- "Read capabilities here" speaks the granted capabilities of the focused Quillin
  on demand, the analogue of rtf.md's "Read keywords here."
- "Go to capability" lists every Quillin that holds a given capability ("network: 2
  Quillins; filesystem: 1"), so a user can audit by capability rather than by
  Quillin, entirely by keyboard and entirely spoken.
- Provenance is announced on demand, never implied: a one-key "Where did this come
  from?" affordance (already promised in §17.2) speaks publisher and trust tier.

The principle is identical to rtf.md's keywords: take state the industry shows as a
glanceable badge and make it something a blind power user can add up, audit, and
act on by ear.

### 19.5 The adapter discipline: Quillins behind a stable, swappable seam

rtf.md's grammar design refuses to hand-roll an engine and instead wraps a real
one (Harper) behind a pure `quill/core` adapter that emits stable typed records,
so the engine can be swapped without touching the app. Quillins already embody the
same discipline, and this document should name it as the shared pattern:

- The `QuillExtensionApi` is the adapter seam (§5): every method maps to an
  existing core operation, so a Quillin never sees a `wx` widget and the host can
  evolve behind a versioned facade exactly as the grammar adapter hides Harper.
- The contribution grammar (§4) is the single registration vocabulary for both
  first-party modules and Quillins (§16), the same "one protocol, many
  implementations" idea rtf.md applies to its editor-surface protocol.
- New host capabilities (a future grammar engine, a Compose-mode surface, a
  keyword store) should be exposed to Quillins as additional capability-gated
  adapter methods, never as raw access, keeping the seam stable as QUILL grows.

### 19.6 Honest limits, stated plainly

rtf.md states its constraints rather than hiding them, and §16.3 already does this
well. Carrying the principle forward, three limits bind Quillins specifically:

- A Quillin can never become the editor surface, the announcement engine, or the
  accessibility path; those are the framework's central guarantee (§16.3), exactly
  as rtf.md refuses to pluginize the writing path.
- A Quillin can only *describe* UI, never draw it (§18); the finite field
  vocabulary is the safety property, the same way rtf.md's accessible preview is
  structured text rather than an opaque rendering.
- Anything that cannot be made fully spoken and keyboard-driven is out of scope for
  a Quillin and must be a reviewed first-party module instead.

## Appendix A — Language options considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Python (embedded, app's own language)** | No new runtime; whole object model already Python; best debugging/docs/stdlib; faithful analogue of scripting a .NET editor in a .NET language; easiest to maintain | In-process sandboxing is weak — must run out-of-process for real isolation | **Chosen (Layer 2)** |
| **JavaScript (QuickJS / V8 via `py_mini_racer`)** | Familiar to most; strong sandbox (isolates / no ambient I/O); QuickJS tiny | Permanent Python⇄JS marshalling; cross-boundary stack traces; native build/packaging dependency; async/wx impedance | Optional future snippet evaluator only |
| **Lua (`lupa`/LuaJIT)** | Classic embeddable scripting; tiny; easy to sandbox | Small user base among QUILL power users; another language to learn; weak text-tooling stdlib | Rejected |
| **WASM (Extism / Wasmtime)** | Strongest sandbox; language-agnostic | Heavy; complex host bindings; hard to author/debug; overkill | Rejected for 2.0 |
| **Declarative-only (manifest)** | Safest; covers ~70% of requests; trivially accessible to author | Not Turing-complete; power users hit a ceiling | **Chosen (Layer 1), paired with Python** |

## Appendix B — Why out-of-process

QUILL's concurrency model already runs OCR in a separate worker process and
marshals UI updates through `wx.CallAfter`. Reusing that pattern for the
extension host gives real fault isolation (a runaway extension can't corrupt the
buffer or freeze the editor) and is the only way to meaningfully sandbox Python.
The UI side remains the sole owner of the editor buffer; the extension side only
ever sends intents over the RPC bridge.
