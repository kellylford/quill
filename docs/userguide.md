# Quill User Guide

Quill is a screen-reader-first writing and reading environment for Windows. It is designed to feel calm, predictable, deeply keyboard-friendly, and respectful of your focus. It is also ambitious. Quill is not only a place to write plain text. It is a place to open difficult documents, inspect structure, navigate long material, compare revisions, prepare content for Markdown or HTML, and work with accessibility and extraction issues without leaving the editor.

This guide is written as a companion, not a reference wall. Read it from the beginning if you are new to Quill. Dip into the sections that matter most if you already know what kind of work you want to do.

Quill is also in beta. Expect polish, depth, and real daily utility. Also expect rough edges, unfinished flows, and the occasional surprise. If you find something confusing or broken, that is useful information. Quill is becoming stronger because real people are trying it on real work.

## Start Here

If you only have five minutes, do this:

1. Press `Ctrl+N` to create a new document, or press `Ctrl+O` to open one.
2. Type a few lines.
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette.
4. Type `guide`, `spell`, `compare`, or `glow` and notice how quickly Quill turns intent into action.
5. Press `F6` to move into the status bar and hear how Quill treats even the bottom of the window as a working surface.
6. Press `F7` for spell check, `Ctrl+F` to search, or `Ctrl+K` to insert a link.

If you ever feel lost, use **Help → What Can I Do Here?**. Think of that command as the editor quietly putting a mentor beside you.

## What Quill Feels Like

Quill is built around a few promises.

- The keyboard is never second-class.
- Screen readers are not an afterthought.
- Every major action is reachable from the menu, the palette, and the command system.
- Documents open locally and stay local unless you explicitly choose a network-aware action.
- The editor should tell you what changed, where you are, and what is possible next.

In practice, that means Quill spends a lot of attention on focus movement, meaningful status updates, discoverable commands, and native Windows controls. It also means Quill tries to reduce fear. When you open a recovered draft, compare two files, inspect extraction quality, or apply a deterministic GLOW fix, the point is not to feel clever. The point is to feel safe.

## Your First Session

Imagine your first meaningful visit to Quill.

You launch the app. There is no splash screen. The window appears quickly, with a menu bar, an editor, and a status bar. If Quill detects a screen reader, it adjusts its hints and announcement style. If Quill notices an earlier crash or autosave state, it offers recovery instead of silently hoping you forgot.

From there, a natural first session looks like this:

1. Open a file with `Ctrl+O` or create one with `Ctrl+N`.
2. Read or write in the editor.
3. Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` to explore commands without memorizing everything.
4. Use the **Navigate** menu to jump by line, heading, block, region, or page.
5. Use the **Tools** menu for spelling, word count, extraction review, compare, macros, regex help, and GLOW workflows.
6. Open **Help → Open Keyboard Reference** to see the exact shortcuts that exist in your current configuration, including your keyboard pack and any custom bindings.

That first session matters because it teaches the most important Quill habit: you do not need to hunt. If an action exists, Quill wants you to be able to reach it from where you already are.

## The Main Window

Quill keeps its main window intentionally simple.

### Menu bar

The menu bar follows the Windows and Office order you likely expect:

- File
- Edit
- View
- Navigate
- Format
- Tools
- Window
- Help

The menu bar is exhaustive rather than decorative. If Quill can do something, there is almost certainly a menu path for it.

### Editor surface

The editor is the heart of Quill. It is where writing happens, where extracted text lands, where reports open as ordinary tabs, and where GLOW previews and compare summaries feel like first-class documents rather than pop-ups.

The editor supports:

- plain text writing
- Markdown-aware authoring
- HTML-aware authoring
- structural navigation
- selection helpers
- text cleanup
- spell and thesaurus workflows
- link insertion and link following
- compare-driven review

### Tabs and document switching

Quill is multi-document. Each open file lives in a notebook tab. You can:

- move between documents with `Ctrl+Tab` and `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`
- close the active document with `Ctrl+W`
- use the tab context menu to close one tab, close other tabs, or close tabs to the right
- reveal a saved document in File Explorer directly from the tab context menu

Quill also opens generated artifacts as tabs. The welcome guide, keyboard reference, compare summary, GLOW audit report, and GLOW fix preview all feel like normal working tabs. That is deliberate. Artifacts should stay close to the work that created them.

### Status bar

The status bar is interactive. It is not just a strip of passive text.

Use `F6` to move into it. Once there, you can move between cells and activate them. Depending on your layout and current state, the status bar can surface:

- current message
- line and column
- word count
- insert or overwrite mode
- selection size
- encoding
- line endings
- spell-check state
- background task state
- notifications
- read-aloud state
- autosave timing
- current search term
- file path or unsaved state

You can reorder or hide status items through **Tools → Customize → Status Bar Layout...**.

### Region cycling

Use `F6` and `Shift+F6` to move between major regions. Quill treats region movement as a first-class accessibility feature. If you write, inspect, and navigate entirely from the keyboard, this becomes second nature quickly.

## The Menu Bar Reference

This section walks the entire menu bar in the order you will encounter it.

### File

The **File** menu is the full document lifecycle.

- **New** creates a blank document.
- **Open...** opens a document from disk.
- **Open Recent** returns quickly to recently used files.
- **Open from URL...** downloads a document or text resource through an explicit safety flow that confirms host and expected size.
- **Sessions** lets you save and reopen groups of documents.
- **Save** writes the current document.
- **Save As...** writes to a new path.
- **Save All** writes every modified open document.
- **Save As Plain Text...** exports a clean plain-text version.
- **Reload from Disk** throws away in-memory edits and reloads the file from storage after confirmation.
- **Restore Backup...** lets you restore a saved backup version.
- **Page Setup...**, **Print Preview...**, and **Print...** support paper and print workflows.
- **Close Document** closes the current tab.
- **Exit** closes the application.

The File menu is also where Quill quietly proves that it respects risk. Reload is explicit. Backup restore is explicit. URL opening is explicit. Nothing important is hidden behind a side effect.

### Edit

The **Edit** menu is where writing muscles live.

Standard clipboard commands are here:

- Undo
- Redo
- Cut
- Copy
- Paste
- Copy With Source
- Select All

Quill then goes further with selection and navigation-aware editing:

- **Extend Selection Mode** turns selection growth into a dedicated mode.
- **Selection** submenu includes Select Line, Select Paragraph, Select Block, Select to Start or End of Line, and Select to Start or End of Document.
- **Mark Ring** commands let you set, pop, exchange, and list marks. If you come from editors with a stronger structural navigation culture, this becomes a favorite quickly.
- **Insert Link...** creates a format-aware link.
- **Follow Link** opens the link under the caret.
- **Find...** and **Replace All...** sit here as expected.
- **Preferences...** opens the broader customization surface.

### View

The **View** menu controls how Quill behaves on screen without changing your content.

- **Enable System Tray Mode** lets Quill minimize into the tray instead of exiting.
- **Toggle Soft Wrap** changes line wrapping without modifying the file.
- **Toggle Dark Mode** switches between system and dark presentation.
- **Enable Persistent Undo** stores undo history across sessions for saved files.
- **Spell Check As You Type** enables live misspelling hints.
- **Show Line Numbers** changes the navigation and status-bar experience.
- **Start With No Document Open** makes Quill open into an empty workspace instead of a starter document.

### Navigate

The **Navigate** menu is one of Quill's strongest differentiators. It assumes you may need to move through large, dense, or extracted material without visual scanning.

Core location commands:

- **Go To Line...**
- **Go To Page...**
- **Back Location**
- **Forward Location**

Structural movement commands:

- **Next Heading**
- **Previous Heading**
- **Next Block**
- **Previous Block**
- **Outline Navigator...**
- **Match Bracket**
- **Next Structure**
- **Previous Structure**
- **Next Region**
- **Previous Region**

Bookmark and search navigation:

- **Set Bookmark...**
- **Go To Bookmark...**
- **Find Next**
- **Find Previous**
- **Find All Matches**

If your work involves transcripts, legal text, long Markdown notes, HTML source, or extracted PDFs, spend time here. This is the menu that turns Quill from a text box into a navigable workspace.

### Format

The **Format** menu handles presentation and markup-aware editing.

Case operations:

- Upper Case
- Lower Case
- Title Case
- Sentence Case
- Toggle Case

Comment and indentation tools:

- Toggle Line Comment
- Toggle Block Comment
- Indent
- Outdent

Line operations:

- Move Line Up
- Move Line Down
- Duplicate Line
- Delete Line
- Join Lines

Inline and structural formatting:

- Bold
- Italic
- Insert Heading levels 1 through 6
- Increase or decrease heading level
- Insert bullet, numbered, and task lists
- Insert code block
- Insert footnote
- Insert table
- Insert HTML tag
- Insert Markdown tag

Quill treats Markdown and HTML as working surfaces, not special-purpose export formats. This menu is where that philosophy becomes practical.

### Tools

The **Tools** menu is Quill's workshop. It contains high-value actions that are not best understood as raw editing.

#### Discovery and command access

- **Command Palette...**

The palette is one of the fastest ways to learn Quill. It supports query modes:

- normal search or `>` for general command search
- `:` to search command IDs
- `?` to favor bound commands
- `~` to emphasize recently used commands

The palette also learns from usage. Commands you use more often rise naturally.

#### Writing aids

- **Word Count...**
- **Spell Check...**
- **Next Misspelling**
- **Thesaurus...**
- **Dictionary Status...**

These help you stay inside the editor instead of breaking flow for small writing chores.

#### Reading aids

- **Read Aloud** submenu for start or pause, stop, and voice selection
- **EPUB Navigator...**
- **OCR Image...**

Read Aloud is particularly useful for proofreading by ear. EPUB Navigator gives a chapter-aware entry point when working with e-books. OCR Image handles image-to-text work with an explicit consent and progress flow.

#### Document intake and extraction review

- **Document Intake Report...**
- **Review Extraction Quality...**
- **Report Bad Extraction...**

These commands matter when Quill is acting as a trusted reader for imported formats rather than a plain writer. They help answer questions like:

- How good was the extraction?
- Did the source likely contain structure that did not survive?
- Is this document safe to quote from directly?
- Do I need to escalate this source for manual cleanup?

#### GLOW

- **GLOW Audit Current Document**
- **GLOW Audit Selection**
- **GLOW Fix Current Document**
- **GLOW Fix Selection**

GLOW inside Quill is a guided layout and output workflow for deterministic text review. Today it focuses on plain text, Markdown, and HTML. It looks for issues such as:

- missing spaces after Markdown heading markers
- heading-level jumps
- generic link text
- missing HTML language metadata
- missing HTML image alt attributes
- tables without HTML header cells
- dense paragraphs and plain-language friction

The key design choice is how GLOW feels inside Quill. Audit results open as readable Quill tabs. Fixing the current document opens a named preview tab and immediately starts a compare session against the original. Selection fixes apply in place to the current selection, paragraph, or line. That keeps GLOW close to the writing experience instead of making it feel like a detached compliance tool.

#### Power tools and cleanup

- **Regex Helper...**
- **Pandoc Conversion Wizard...**
- **External Tools and Format Support...**
- **Macros** submenu
- **Convert** submenu with sort, reverse, deduplicate, trim trailing whitespace, normalize whitespace, and convert indentation commands

These are especially valuable in large cleanup jobs and repetitive editing workflows.

The new external-tools surface deserves a special note. Quill does not treat optional tools as hidden technical chores. **External Tools and Format Support...** explains what each supported helper unlocks, whether Quill can already see it, and what the best first touch point is. If Pandoc is installed or bundled, **Pandoc Conversion Wizard...** can turn supported source files into Markdown, HTML, or plain text tabs that open directly in Quill. That makes Quill feel less like a dead-end editor and more like a calm bridge into real-world document cleanup and GLOW-oriented handoff work.

#### Compare and analysis

- **Compare with File...**
- **Compare Open Documents**
- **Compare Next Difference**
- **Compare Previous Difference**
- **Difference List**
- **Compare Options**
- **Compare Summary**
- **Copy Current Difference**
- **Copy All Differences**

Quill's compare model is practical and local. It supports file-to-file review, multi-document review, summary generation, and synchronized movement through differences.

#### Accessibility and inspection

- **Accessibility Audit...**
- **Keyboard Trap Snapshot...**
- **Validate Contrast...**
- **Link Inventory...**

These tools help review the editor experience itself, the current document's link surface, and low-vision presentation issues.

#### System integration and customization

- **Notifications...**
- **Check for Updates...**
- **Shell Integration** commands
- **Profiles and Features...**
- **Status Bar Layout...**
- **Keymap Editor...**
- **Export Keymap...**
- **Import Keymap...**
- **Reset Keymap**

### Window

The **Window** menu is small but useful.

- **Next Document**
- **Previous Document**
- **Send to System Tray**

When you are juggling multiple notes, extracted files, and audit previews, these commands keep the workspace feeling controlled.

### Help

The **Help** menu is where Quill becomes a guide.

- **Open User Guide** opens this guide as an in-app document.
- **Open Welcome Guide** opens a lighter, profile-aware getting-started document.
- **Open Keyboard Reference** generates the current live shortcut reference from the active command registry.
- **Save Diagnostics...** writes a local diagnostics bundle you can review before sharing.
- **Report a Bug...** opens the Community Access support-hub issue form and copies an environment summary to the clipboard.
- **What Can I Do Here?** gives context-aware assistance.
- **Why Don't I See a Feature?** explains profile-driven feature visibility.
- **Feature Profiles** commands let you switch profile, run health checks, undo the last profile change, reset to Essential, and run onboarding.
- **Check for Updates...** verifies the signed update manifest.
- **About Quill** shows version and publisher details.

If you only remember one thing about Help, remember this: it is a working surface, not a dead-end menu. The welcome guide teaches the basics, the keyboard reference reflects your live bindings, the user guide gives the full map, diagnostics package the current state, and the bug-report action turns that state into a support-ready starting point.

## Writing and Editing

Quill's editing model is fast once you stop thinking of it as only a textbox.

### Everyday editing

Use the familiar commands first:

- `Ctrl+Z` to undo
- `Ctrl+Y` to redo
- `Ctrl+X`, `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+V` to move text
- `Ctrl+A` to select everything

Quill adds two especially useful ideas on top of that.

### Copy With Source

`Ctrl+Shift+C` copies the current selection, then appends a source reference that captures document context. If nothing is selected, Quill uses the current line. This is excellent for notes, review workflows, and evidence gathering.

### Extend Selection Mode and marks

`F8` toggles Extend Selection Mode. This lets you grow selections more deliberately. The mark ring adds an editor-like memory of important places in a document. Set a mark, move, then return or exchange point and mark when you need to re-anchor yourself.

### Links

`Ctrl+K` inserts a format-aware link. `Ctrl+Enter` follows the link under the caret. In Markdown and HTML, this makes citation and cross-referencing much less tedious.

## Search, Replace, and Deep Navigation

Quill's search tools are both straightforward and layered.

### Standard search

- `Ctrl+F` opens search.
- `F3` finds next.
- `Shift+F3` finds previous.
- `Alt+F3` opens a find-all matches summary.
- `Ctrl+H` opens Replace All.

### Search modes

Quill supports plain text, whole-word, wildcard, and regular-expression search. The Regex Helper explains the syntax when you need it. Search history is also preserved, so recurring search jobs get easier over time.

### Navigation that understands documents

Quill is excellent for large documents because it supports:

- line and page jumps
- block and heading movement
- bracket matching
- structural next and previous
- back and forward location history
- outline navigation
- bookmarks

When you combine this with marks and compare sessions, long-form review starts to feel much less fragile.

## Formatting and Markup Work

Quill understands that many users work in plain text while still caring deeply about exported structure.

### Markdown and HTML awareness

Quill detects whether the current surface looks like Markdown, HTML, or plain text. It uses that to guide insertion helpers and enable the commands that make sense in context.

### Headings and lists

The heading tools do more than insert decoration. They help you maintain usable structure. The list tools speed up common authoring patterns without forcing you into a separate composer.

### Tables, code blocks, and tags

Quill includes guided insertion for tables, code blocks, HTML tags, and Markdown snippets. This is especially useful for users who want structure but do not want to hand-type every opening and closing marker correctly every time.

### Cleanup and normalization

The cleanup commands under **Tools → Convert** are ideal for pasted material, transcripts, exports, and migration work. Use them when you need to turn messy text into something more stable and readable.

## Tools for Reading, Review, and Inspection

Quill earns trust by making difficult files readable and inspectable.

### Read Aloud

Read Aloud uses local voices when available. You can start, pause, stop, and choose a voice. It is useful for proofreading by ear, reviewing extracted text, and staying oriented in dense material.

### EPUB Navigator

When you open an EPUB, the navigator gives you chapter-aware movement rather than forcing you to scroll blindly through one long extraction.

### OCR Image

OCR is explicit and local. You choose the image, confirm the action, and receive progress updates. This keeps OCR useful without making it invisible or surprising.

### Document intake and extraction quality

These commands are where Quill feels especially mature for accessibility-minded reading work. Rather than assuming every import is trustworthy, Quill gives you tools to ask whether the extraction is good enough, what may have been lost, and whether you should quote from the result directly.

## GLOW Workflows Inside Quill

Glow in Quill is about guided confidence. It is not trying to turn the editor into a giant compliance dashboard. It is trying to make accessibility-aware review and safe deterministic fixes feel ordinary.

### Audit flows

Use document audit when you want the whole file reviewed. Use selection audit when you only care about the paragraph, block, or snippet in front of you.

Audit results open as normal Quill tabs. You can read them, search them, compare them, or keep them open alongside the source.

### Fix flows

Use selection fix for quick cleanup in place. Use document fix when you want Quill to generate a preview and immediately compare original versus fixed output.

This is where the native integration matters most. GLOW does not pull you away from your working context. It creates another working context beside it.

### What GLOW is best at today

The first native slice is strongest with:

- plain text review
- Markdown cleanup
- HTML accessibility-aware cleanup
- link-text review
- heading spacing and heading-level sanity
- lightweight readability guidance

The v1.1 roadmap expands this into findings navigation, export-readiness workflows, and richer extraction-aware review for PDF and EPUB.

## Accessibility and Low-Vision Features

Quill is designed so accessibility is visible, not hidden.

### Region model

Use `F6` and `Shift+F6` to move between editor and other major regions. Quill announces those region transitions consistently.

### Keyboard trap and accessibility audit

The keyboard trap snapshot and accessibility audit commands are there to help verify the interface itself. This is useful both for users and for testers helping improve the product.

### Contrast and theme behavior

You can validate contrast, switch dark mode, and align with system behavior. This matters for users who need a predictable low-vision experience rather than a single visual theme.

### Status bar as an accessible control surface

Quill's status bar is navigable and interactive. This is a subtle but important design decision. It keeps useful information close while still making it reachable from the keyboard.

## Profiles, Keyboard Packs, and Customization

Quill is customizable, but it tries to keep customization coherent.

### Feature profiles

Profiles shape which feature clusters are on, quiet, or off. This helps Quill stay calm for new users without stripping power from advanced users.

Use **Profiles and Features...** to:

- switch profiles
- compare profiles
- undo the last profile change
- reset to Essential
- import and export profile data

### Keyboard packs

Quill now supports golden keyboard packs so the editor can feel familiar from day one. Available packs include:

- Quill Default
- Quill Writer
- Quill Navigation
- Quill Review
- Windows Notepad
- Notepad++
- VS Code
- Microsoft Word

Choose a pack in **Profiles and Features...**. If you later hand-edit shortcuts or import a custom keymap, Quill automatically switches the pack label to **Custom**.

### Keymap editor

Use the keymap editor when you want to rebind a single command. Quill detects conflicts and warns you before reassigning a binding already in use.

### Status bar layout

If the current status bar is too busy or not informative enough, change it. You can reorder items and choose which ones stay visible.

### Settings you can change today

Quill's current settings and customization surface covers the things you are most likely to want to tune every day.

- theme behavior, including dark mode
- soft wrap
- recent files limit
- system tray mode
- persistent undo
- spell check as you type
- line-number visibility
- whether Quill starts with no document open
- read-aloud voice selection
- active feature profile
- active keyboard pack
- custom keybindings through the keymap editor
- status-bar order and status-bar visibility

Some of these live in the View menu for quick toggling. Others live in **Profiles and Features...**, **Status Bar Layout...**, **Keymap Editor...**, and the related customization commands under **Tools**.

## Trust, Recovery, Sessions, and Safety

Quill is serious about recovery and user control.

### Sessions

Sessions let you reopen groups of documents. This is useful when a project naturally spans multiple notes, references, and generated reports.

### Autosave and backups

Quill autosaves at a timed interval and keeps backup snapshots. It avoids unnecessary duplicate autosave writes and keeps state management efficient.

### Recovery

If Quill closes unexpectedly, it can offer a recovery snapshot on the next launch. That is not a dramatic feature. It is a humane one.

### Persistent undo

When enabled, persistent undo stores undo history for saved files across sessions. Quill now throttles those writes so the feature stays practical on large documents.

### Trusted locations

Trusted locations reduce repeated prompts when you regularly work from the same folders. This is especially useful in document-review and institutional workflows.

### Safe mode

Safe mode opens Quill with optional state turned off. If you are troubleshooting a bad session or strange startup behavior, safe mode is a good first step.

### Notifications and updates

Quill keeps an internal notification center for update and workflow events. Update checks verify a signed manifest before offering a download.

## Working with Different Document Types

Quill is strongest today with plain text, Markdown, HTML, EPUB, and extracted text workflows. It also has intake and extraction review features for imported material such as PDF and OCR sources.

### Plain text

Plain text stays plain. Quill does not force hidden formatting into it.

### Markdown

Markdown gets structure-aware commands, list helpers, heading helpers, links, code blocks, and GLOW review.

### HTML

HTML gets tag insertion, structure-aware editing help, link handling, and GLOW review focused on language metadata, image alt text, heading order, and table headers.

### EPUB

EPUB gets navigator support and chapter-oriented reading.

### PDF and OCR-derived text

PDF and OCR work are where Quill's extraction review commands matter most. Treat those commands as quality checks, not optional extras.

## Help, Learning, and Daily Confidence

Quill includes several layers of help because confidence does not come from memorizing everything.

- **Open Welcome Guide** when you want a lighter orientation.
- **Open User Guide** when you want the full map.
- **Open Keyboard Reference** when you want exact current bindings.
- **What Can I Do Here?** when you need immediate, contextual guidance.
- **Why Don't I See a Feature?** when a command seems to have disappeared.

That last command matters more than it first appears. It turns feature visibility from a mystery into an explanation.

## Beta Feedback and Bug Reporting

Quill is ready for serious beta use, but one public-beta readiness item still deserves honest attention: a secure, low-friction, no-login feedback path.

### What exists today

Today, Quill already has the foundations for careful support work:

- recovery state
- notifications
- extraction review
- bad-extraction package export for extraction-related issues
- a general-purpose **Save Diagnostics...** command that writes a local bundle
- a **Report a Bug...** command that opens the Community Access support-hub form with environment context
- a diagnostics runbook and beta feedback plan in the documentation set

### What still needs to improve

Today, Quill still does **not** yet ship a polished no-login secure upload path directly from the desktop app, and it still needs a more public, more discoverable beta support route than a GitHub-backed form alone.

### Best beta-launch recommendation

Before the broadest public beta push, publish one secure feedback route that does not require GitHub login. The best release-quality path is still:

1. a BITS-controlled HTTPS feedback form
2. optional upload of a user-reviewed diagnostics bundle
3. a plain-language bug template with environment summary and reproduction steps
4. GitHub issues as a secondary path for testers who already use GitHub

Until that exists, use the current support-hub issue form as a practical bridge rather than the final answer. The important improvement is that Quill now helps users gather diagnostics locally, review what is being shared, and start a structured support report without throwing them into an empty issue box.

## A Fast Shortcut Tour

If you want a compact set of shortcuts to remember first, start here:

- `Ctrl+N`, `Ctrl+O`, `Ctrl+S`, `Ctrl+Shift+S`
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` for the Command Palette
- `Ctrl+F`, `F3`, `Shift+F3`, `Alt+F3`
- `Ctrl+G` and `Ctrl+Shift+G`
- `Ctrl+K` and `Ctrl+Enter`
- `F7`, `Alt+F7`, `Shift+F7`
- `Ctrl+Shift+W` for Word Count
- `Ctrl+Tab` and `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`
- `F6` and `Shift+F6`
- `Alt+Z` for soft wrap

Then open **Help → Open Keyboard Reference** and let Quill teach you the rest from your actual active layout.

## Closing Thought

The best way to understand Quill is to use it on something real: a note you care about, an extracted PDF that needs trust review, an EPUB chapter you want to navigate, a Markdown file you want to clean up, or an HTML document you want to make more usable.

Quill is trying to feel like a skilled guide sitting just beside the editor, not standing in front of it. If it succeeds, you will notice something simple: you spend less time wondering what the application can do, and more time deciding what you want to do next.
