Line and structure editing includes:

- move line up and down
- duplicate line
- delete line
- join lines
- indent and outdent
- toggle line and block comments
- trimming and cleanup helpers for consistent text quality

### Search, replace, and navigation

Quill supports both simple and advanced search flows:

- find, find next, find previous
- replace and replace all
- wildcard and regex search modes
- redesigned accessible Regex Helper with presets, plain-language explanations, sample-text preview, and copy-pattern workflow
- search history and repeated search workflows
- find all matches summary reporting

Navigation features include:

- go to line and page
- previous and next location jumps
- heading navigation
- block and structure navigation
- outline navigator for fast structural movement
- bracket matching
- next and previous region movement

### QUILL Quick Nav mode (browse-style cursor navigation)

Quill 0.1.5 Beta introduces a dedicated browse-style quick navigation mode.

- enter with `Ctrl+Shift+Grave`
- exit with `Esc`
- move by heading with `H` and `Shift+H`
- move by heading level with `1` through `6` and reverse with `Shift+1` through `Shift+6`
- move by anchor with `A` and `Shift+A`
- move by list with `L` and `Shift+L`
- move by list item with `I` and `Shift+I`
- move by table with `T` and `Shift+T`
- move by block quote with `Q` and `Shift+Q`
- move by bookmark with `B` and `Shift+B`
- move by code block with `'` and `Shift+'`
- open table of contents with `C`
- move by paragraph with `P` and `Shift+P`
- move by sentence with `S` and `Shift+S`
- move by block with `Tab` and `Shift+Tab`

Quick Nav mode is movement-only. It does not edit text.

How Quill keeps track of artifacts in Markdown and HTML:

- Quill builds and caches a navigation index for the active document.
- Headings are indexed from parsed Markdown and HTML heading structures.
- List-item anchors are indexed from Markdown list syntax and HTML `<li>` tags.
- Paragraph anchors are indexed from blank-line boundaries (text and Markdown) and block-level HTML tags.
- Sentence anchors are indexed from sentence punctuation boundaries.
- Indexes are invalidated when the document changes, when full-text replacement happens, and when the user switches tabs.

This model keeps quick-nav movement responsive while preserving correct jumps across large documents.

### Formatting, markup, and authoring

Quill is strong in plain text and markup authoring:

- case conversion tools
- format-aware insertion workflows for headings, lists, links, tables, and code blocks
- link insertion and follow link
- heading insertion and level controls
- heading style controls (font, size, alignment)
- heading organizer for level repair, reorder, and validation
- list insertion and management
- code block insertion
- table insertion
- dedicated Markdown and HTML tag assist tools

	to align migration work from BITS Whisperer into Quill.
- Quill now includes a **Speech Models** manager under **BITS Whisperer** with machine-aware
	recommendations and phased model visibility.
- Speech model setup now supports a guided **Recommended** mode plus a **Manual** model-selection mode,
	while keeping runtime behavior stable during this phase.
- Provider onboarding now includes a guided **Provider Center** under **BITS Whisperer** with local-first
	and cloud-first planning flows, readiness checks, and staged provider selection.
- **Help -> Status Page (HTML Preview)** now refreshes live while open, including BITS Whisperer model
	download state and broader asynchronous speech/task status.
- Users can keep auto-open status behavior off by default and opt in from Preferences, plus tune
	screen-reader refresh cadence with Quiet/Normal/Verbose announcement modes.
- BITS Whisperer now includes rollout-safe insight tools: **Readiness Check**, **Capability Matrix**,
	and **Download Queue** controls for retry/cleanup/status workflows.
- General Preferences now includes a **Use Artificial Intelligence** toggle (mirrors the AI menu)
	and a **BITS Whisperer safe mode lock** option for guarded rollout operation.
- QUILL now ships robust command-line startup options, including `--help`, `--version`,
	`--line`, `--column`, `--new-window`, and `--wait`.
- The first phase focuses on safe model management and guidance, including faster-whisper engine
	checks, while deeper transcription runtime behavior will roll out gradually.

### External tools and conversion workflows

Quill supports optional external tooling with guided onboarding and capability discovery:

- Pandoc integration for conversion workflows
- OCR tooling pathways (for image and extraction support scenarios)

- RTF

Additional intake and review flows include:

- CSV and TSV
- Word (.docx and .doc)
- EPUB
- PowerPoint (.pptx and .ppt)
- spreadsheet-style formats (.xlsx and .xls)
- PDF and OCR-assisted pathways
- Pages and related extraction bridges where available

Release-safety note for this beta cycle:

- Word and CSV/TSV currently default to opening in the normal plain-text editor surface.
- Structured Word and CSV grid code paths remain in the codebase behind an internal gate while validation continues.

### Profiles, keymaps, and customization

Customization features include:

- feature profiles (including minimal and fuller experiences)
- keyboard packs for different editing conventions
- keymap management and preview tools

### Packaging and installer experience

Current build and installer work includes:

- polished Windows distribution output
- Inno Setup integration
- executable-first launch shortcuts where possible (to reduce extra console windows)
- optional bundled component wiring for Pandoc in installer flows

## Why this matters

Quill 0.1.5 Beta is not a narrow patch. It is a broad capability release that makes Quill viable for:

- daily writing and editing
- markup-heavy technical authoring
- accessibility review and deterministic cleanup
- complex import and conversion workflows
- revision and comparison-heavy editing
- local-first AI-assisted drafting and refinement

## Translation process and community effort

QUILL's localization direction is community-first and modeled on a gettext catalog workflow (`POT -> PO -> MO`). The project is building translation as a release discipline, not as an afterthought.

For contributors, translation work starts with GitHub pull requests against locale catalogs and clear translator comments. As the contributor base grows, QUILL will add a dedicated translation portal flow while keeping gettext catalogs as the source of truth.

The contributor plan, release cadence, quality gates, and translator expectations live in the new planning doc:

- [QUILL Translation Contributor Plan](localization/translation-contributor-plan.md)

## What is still in beta

Quill is still a beta release, which means:

- some workflows are deeper than others
- some integrations depend on optional local tools
- behavior can still be tuned based on real-world feedback

But the feature surface is already substantial and practical for real work.

## How to get the most from 0.1.5

1. Start with the user guide to pick workflows that match your daily work.
2. Use the command palette to discover features quickly.
3. Try one advanced workflow at a time: compare, preview, GLOW, or assistant.
4. Report rough edges with diagnostics so the next release can harden where it matters most.

Quill 0.1.5 Beta is ready for serious use, and this release is intentionally built to make the full capability surface visible instead of hidden.
