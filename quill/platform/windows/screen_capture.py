"""Image capture sources for OCR (OCR-3): clipboard and screen.

Windows-only, fully offline helpers that produce a temporary PNG path which the
existing :func:`quill.io.ocr.ocr_image` pipeline can consume unchanged. No
``wx`` imports: capturing the clipboard image, the whole screen, or the active
window is platform work, while the recognition and review surfaces stay in
``quill/io`` and ``quill/ui`` respectively.

Both ``Pillow`` (``PIL.ImageGrab``) and, for the active-window rectangle,
``pywin32`` (``win32gui``) are required. When either is missing, or the call
runs off Windows, the helpers raise :class:`ScreenCaptureError` with a clear,
announce-ready message instead of failing obscurely.
