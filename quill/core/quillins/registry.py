"""Aggregate Quillin contributions and detect conflicts.

Each validated manifest contributes commands, menu items, context-menu entries,
and hotkeys. Across *several* enabled Quillins these must be merged into a single
picture the host can wire onto its menus and keymap. Two rules from
``docs/quillins.md`` are enforced here:

* A contributed ``ext.*`` command id must be **globally unique** across enabled
  Quillins (§15 rule 4 lifts uniqueness from per-file to per-install).
* A hotkey binding must not collide with the host keymap or another Quillin.
  Conflicts are **rejected, never silently overridden** (§4) — the conflicting
  contribution is dropped and recorded so the Quillins Manager can announce it.

This module imports no ``wx`` and performs no IO.
