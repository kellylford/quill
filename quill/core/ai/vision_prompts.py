"""Built-in vision prompt styles for the Image Description Toolkit (IDT).

Twelve evaluated prompt styles that produce substantially different image
descriptions depending on the use case.  Each constant holds the full prompt
text sent to the vision model.  The ``BUILTIN_PROMPT_STYLES`` list is the
canonical registry consumed by the UI picker and the Manage Image Prompts
dialog.

The prompts are immutable constants — users can disable built-in styles and
add custom prompts, but the shipped text is never edited in place.

    "relationships between objects and people. "
    "Include what is in the foreground, middle ground, and background. "
    "Be thorough but natural — write as if you are telling someone what "
    "they would see if they were standing in front of the image."

    "Describe this image in structured detail using these sections: "
    "SUBJECT — what or who is the main focus; "
    "SETTING — where this takes place and what surrounds the subject; "
    "COLORS — the dominant and accent colors and how they interact; "
    "COMPOSITION — how elements are arranged, framed, and balanced; "
    "DETAILS — textures, patterns, text, and small elements that matter. "
    "Be precise and thorough in each section."

PROMPT_CONCISE = (
    "Describe this image in two to three sentences. "

    "teal, amber, slate, ochre rather than generic red, blue, yellow. "

    "Describe this image using analogies and comparisons to familiar "

    "lighting, colors, expressions, and composition? "

    "melancholic, mysterious, warm, cold? "
    "Describe the visual elements that create this mood."

PROMPT_FUNCTIONAL = (
    "Describe this image by focusing on function, purpose, and action. "
    "Use active verbs: what illuminates, supports, connects, moves, "
    "contains, directs, or transforms? "
    "Describe what each element does rather than just what it looks like. "
    "If the image shows a tool, device, or structure, explain its "
    "purpose and how its parts work together."

    "Write three alternative text descriptions for this image at "
    "different lengths: "
    "1. Short (about 25 words) — the essential information for a quick scan. "
    "2. Medium (about 50 words) — a balanced description with key details. "
    "3. Long (about 100 words) — a thorough description for full context. "
    "Label each variant clearly with its word-count target. "
    "Each variant should stand alone as a complete alt-text description."
