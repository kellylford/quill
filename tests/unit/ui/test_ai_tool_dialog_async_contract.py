"""DLG-3.6 / DLG-2 guard: safe async + modal contract for AI tool dialogs.

Phase 6 of the dialog estate work (DLG-3.6, which folds in DLG-2) requires the
assistant/AI tool dialogs in ``assistant_tools.py``, ``ai_model_panel.py``,
``style_panel.py``, and ``assistant_panel.py`` to share one modal/focus/error
contract *with safe async/"busy" semantics*: a long-running action disables its
trigger before work starts, runs off the UI thread, marshals every result
(including failures) back with ``CallAfter``, and re-enables the trigger when the
work finishes — so focus never lands on a dead control and a background failure
never leaves the dialog wedged.

This guard pins that structure as source contract so it cannot silently regress.
The manual NVDA/JAWS/Narrator sign-off for these dialogs is tracked separately in
DLG-3.8; this test covers only the machine-verifiable half.
