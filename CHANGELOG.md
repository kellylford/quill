# Changelog

## QUILL Brand Identity

**QUILL** stands for **Quality, Usable, Inclusive, Lightweight, Literate**.

**QUILL: A quality, usable, inclusive, lightweight, and literate editor built for everyone who writes, codes, learns, and creates.**

## Quill 0.1.1 Beta

Quill 0.1.1 Beta advances the 0.1 baseline with update-path hardening, status-bar parity completion, menu/discoverability polish, and documentation alignment.

### Added and improved in 0.1.1

- Completed status-bar interaction parity: focused cell context actions now include **Activate**, **Hide this item**, and **Status bar settings**.
- Added **Restore Defaults** to Status Bar Settings and persisted layout changes.
- Hardened **Help -> Check for Updates...** with guided installer handoff, including close-now support for clean setup.
- Simplified the Search menu to a single **Replace...** entry; replace-all now lives in the Replace dialog and keeps the existing replace-all hotkey path.
- Clarified naming and discoverability around **Workspace Snapshots**, **Recent Marks (Ring)**, and status-bar terminology.
- Expanded regression coverage for search/extend-selection and no-selection transform behavior.
- Added About-dialog acknowledgments for contributors and beta testers.
- Added a full snippets workflow: searchable insert (`Ctrl+Space`), manage (`Ctrl+Alt+Space`), placeholder prompts, trigger expansion, and starter packs.
- Regenerated the signed update feed for `0.1.1`.

## Quill 0.1.0 Beta

Quill 0.1 Beta is the first broad, coherent release of Quill as a screen-reader-first writing, reading, review, and document-intelligence environment for Windows from Blind Information Technology Solutions (BITS) and Community Access.

### Highlights

- Native wxPython editor shell with command palette, tabs, menus, and interactive status bar
- Plain text, Markdown, HTML, EPUB, PDF, DOCX, ODT, RTF, JSON, XML, TOML, CSV, TSV, notebook, and SQLite reading surfaces
- Deterministic GLOW audit and fix workflows inside Quill for plain text, Markdown, and HTML
- Guided optional-tool onboarding for Pandoc, Tesseract OCR, LibreOffice, Ghostscript, HTML Tidy, XML Lint, and PyMarkdown
- Pandoc Conversion Wizard for opening supported source files as Markdown, HTML, or plain text tabs
- In-app diagnostics review before export and in-app bug-report review before launching the Community Access support form
- Autosave, backups, recovery, persistent undo, trusted locations, notifications, and signed update checks
- Windows packaging flow with embedded Python, portable bundle generation, and Inno Setup installer compilation

### What feels new in this release

The Help menu now acts like a real support surface instead of a dead end. Users can review diagnostics before Quill writes a zip, review a bug report before Quill opens the browser, and route support feedback into the shared Community Access support flow with more confidence and less guesswork.

Quill also now has a more practical format-bridge story. With Pandoc available, documents can move into stable text-centric workflows without pushing users into command-line tooling. The external-tools dialog explains what each helper unlocks and keeps the setup story transparent.

### Evening polish updates

- File > Sessions was clarified as **workspace snapshots** with clearer menu labels for saving, opening, recent snapshots, and current workspace documents.
- Mark Ring and Bookmarks language was clarified in-app to distinguish temporary jump points (mark ring) from named jump points (bookmarks).
- Tools menu information architecture was simplified into clear submenus: Writing and Language, Read Aloud, Integrations, Document Intake, Authoring and Automation, Compare Documents, Accessibility, Support, and Customize.
- Added a menu binding contract test so menu IDs and EVT_MENU handlers stay aligned as menus evolve.
- Completed status-bar parity details: focused cell context menu now offers Activate, Hide this item, and Status bar settings.
- Status Bar Settings now includes Restore Defaults and persists layout changes immediately.
- Help -> Check for Updates now includes a guided installer handoff that can close Quill before running setup.
- Version bumped to 0.1.1 for the next patch upgrade path.
- About Quill now includes a sincere thanks to contributors and beta testers: Techopolis, Taylor Arndt, Michael Doise, Kayla Bentas, Shane Popplestone, and Becky Knobb.

### Packaging and release quality

- Embedded Python runtime verification with pinned SHA-256 validation
- Runtime dependency bundling derived from project metadata for UI and spell-check support
- Compiled Windows installer output: `Quill-Setup-0.1.exe`
- Release provenance and SBOM generation support via `scripts/generate_release_artifacts.py`

### Support and feedback

Quill 0.1.1 Beta uses a unified Help-menu support flow. `Help -> Report a Bug...` now handles report preparation, optional diagnostics generation, in-app review, and support-form handoff in one guided path. `Help -> Save Diagnostics...` remains available for standalone diagnostics export.

### Notes

This is a beta release. The product direction is aligned with the Quill 1.0 PRD, while some workflows are still evolving toward that fuller 1.0 target.
